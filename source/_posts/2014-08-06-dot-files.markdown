Dotfiles fascinate me. I enjoy stumbling across a developer's github and taking
a look into their dotfiles. Its a great way to discover useful aliases or
functions. Even new tools can be discovered when I see a previously unknown
dotfile. Each dotfile repo also contains a living bio of the developer. One can
easily learn what OS the developer uses, what programing languages they use the
most, what tools they prefer.
