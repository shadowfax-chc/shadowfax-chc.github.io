Dotfiles fascinate me. I enjoy stumbling across a developer's github and taking
a look into their dotfiles. Its a great way to discover useful aliases or
functions. Even new tools can be discovered when I see a previously unknown
dotfile. Each dotfile repo also contains a living bio of the developer. One can
easily learn what OS the developer uses, what programing languages they use the
most, what tools they prefer.

Recently many of my co-workers switched from a development environment of
`Windows + Putty + Linux Server` to running Linux locally. The big draw for
them was seeing me using [spectrwm], a tiling window manager. Some have decided
to go with [Ubuntu minimal] with [i3], while others have followed me down the
joyous path of [Gentoo] and [spectrwm]. Either way everyone took the
opportunity to examine my dotfiles and grab the parts they liked.

At this point I have read through my own dotfiles several times as I explained
the purpose of each file (I also took this opportunity to clean up some bad
practices), thus it seems like a first post to dive into some of my dots and
explain them. For the Unix aficionado much of this may be obvious, for those
new to Linux or working on the terminal there should be many useful tips.
Hopefully there is some value for everyone.
